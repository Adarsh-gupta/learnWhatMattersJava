Part 2

Chapter 1	--Ternary Operator
				<condition> ? true : false;
			--Type Coversion
				<data_type><var> = <data_type><var or val>;
	
Chapter 2	--Concept of Repetition in Programming
				--Iteration / Loops
				--Recursion
			
			--Loops
				--entry, exit controlled
			--for(init; condition; incre/decre)
				--tweaks (Very IMP)
				--infinite loop question practice

			Q. Print natural number up to n. 
			Q. Sum up to n terms.
			Q. Check if the number is Prime or not.

Chapter 3	--while(conditions)
				--common body for digit seperation problems
			
			Q. Sum of digits of a number
			Q. Accept a number and check if it is a pallindromic number (If number and its reverse are equal)
			
Chapter 4	--do..while(condition);
				--common body for menu based programs
		
			Q. Print hello until user gives wrong input using do while
			Q. Make a choice based calculator using do while
		
Chapter 5	--Project - Guess Game
     				 Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is.
			         If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should display "Too high, try again."
			         If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again."
			         The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.
